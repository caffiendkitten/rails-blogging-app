This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

## Database creation

- Seeded titles from Redit and content if it was available.

## How to run the test suite


## CRUD Actions

- Users can be CREATED and they can CREATE a post.
- Users can READ posts and commpents.
- Users can UPDATE their profile bio as well as their own posts.
- Users can DELETE their posts but not their profile.

## Difficulties 

* Git and needing to wipe out the reposity the second day and reupload it

* Merging to and from the right branch without breaking things

* Getting Redit data to feed in rather than just Faker data.

* Getting users to have a default profile picture.

* Utilizing sessions properly for specific conditions.

* CSSing the site so quickly with little to no working knowledge of it.

* Crashing the site when spamming the 'Like' button. This would need JavaScript to fix as with each like the page needs to reload and incrument the count.

## Stretch Goals

* Getting links to author profiles with in the articles.

* Likes/Dislikes on comments as well as the ability to reply to a comment

* Dislikes on a post

* The ability to change photo or upload photos.

* Links to share articles on the Social Media of choice.
